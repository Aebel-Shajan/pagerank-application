# pagerank-application

My attempt at using the pagerank algorithm on different websites. Pages were scraped using webCrawler.m 
and the results were saved as an adjacency matrix in the data folder as a ".mat"file. Then the data was 
loaded and the pagerank.m function was used on the adjacency matrix to determine the rankings for each 
website.

Crawl a website using web_crawler.mlx. Then get the pagerank as well as other stuff from 
pagerank_implementation.mlx .
